# Monte Carlo Tree Search for Othello

[Monte Carlo tree seach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_tree_search) (MCTS) is a method of implementing game AI (among other things). Possible current game moves are sampled by randomly playing a game to the end from each move. The move which seems to lead to wins most often is the best move to make next.
